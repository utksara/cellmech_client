    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Cellflow is a web application to synthezie and replicate cellular/microbiological simulation. <br>
        In a nutshell it aims to provide an interface to simulate mesospcopic phenonemena which can <br>
        be studied under classical mechanics and micro-fluid dynamics. The app is built on top of a <br>
        dataflow programming based library providing APIs to design interconnected systems </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Design micro-biological system from scratch in a planar medium</li>
        <li>Design virtual experiment of micro-biology</li>
        <li>Use predefined, commonly used equations to run your experiment/simulation or define your own</li>
        <li>Create steady state and real time simulation of your system</li>
        <li><span class="season">(coming soon)</span> Save your data, analyse it, create dashboard</li>
        <li><span class="season">(coming soon)</span> Directly replicate your tangible experimental setup into simulation by uploading images of your experiment</li>
    </ul>
