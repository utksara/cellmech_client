    <h2>What it is about</h2>
    <p> Modeling and simulation has become a common practice in diverse sectors. While most industries have
        sophisticated modeling techniques and software, the academia has still relatively little access
        to quality modeling and simulation software, due to the heavy costs incurred while 
        licensing. Additionally, most of the simulation applications are standalone software mostly
        running on C/CPP code base and designed to cater either too generic or too specific requirements.</br></br>
        The aim of Beehive is to resolve the stated issues by providing 
        <li> An open source, web based M&S framework
        allowing to design simulation in a declarative way while backing up data </li>
        <li>Utilize graphical data structures and distributed computing to enable fast, accuarate and scalable computation</li>
    </p>
    <h2>What it does</h2>
    <p>Beehive allows you to define your problem in declarative way, that is, instead of telling how to do things
        you just declare, what parameters my system need, what functions my system needs, what I need to calculate, what 
        I want to show on the screen, etc. </br>
        The way it works internally, is using DAGS (Directed acyclic graphs) and Dataflow programming. The systems expressed
        using simple paramters are internally transformed into a graph, based on the definition and performs the 
        required computations.</br></br>
        Using this, one can design a variety of simulations in Beehive. The features it provides includes but no limited to-
        <li>Use predefined, commonly used equations to run your experiment/simulation or define your own</li>
        <li>Create steady state simulation of your system</li>
        <li>Visualize any variable/paramters from your results</li>
    </p>
